Refactored my original application (found at https://github.com/Lianathanoj/soundcloud-organizer) to use React with updates to the UI and selection logic.

SoundCloud has the ability to grab the top 50 songs for a given genre, but what happens if someone wanted to dig deeper and find an artist's most popular or most favorite tracks instead? Currently, SoundCloud does not have this more specific capability. This app enables users to sort an artist's tracks by most favorites or most playbacks so they can listen to music they're more likely to enjoy.

To use this app, go to the link, input an artist's permalink, choose however many songs you would like to add, then choose whichever sort functionality you would prefer to use. For instance, if I wanted to find the top tracks from Louis the Child, I would input his permalink "louisthechild" from the permalink URL https://soundcloud.com/louisthechild and press enter.
